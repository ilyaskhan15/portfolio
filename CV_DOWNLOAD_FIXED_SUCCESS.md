## 🔧 **What Was The Problem?**

1. **URL Structure**: Cloudinary was getting malformed URLs with double parameters
2. **Path Mismatch**: Your PDF was stored in `/image/upload/` but code tried `/raw/upload/`
3. **Parameter Format**: The `fl_attachment` flag wasn't properly formatted

## 🛠️ **How It Was Fixed**

### **Smart Fallback System**
The new system tries multiple approaches automatically:

1. **Method 1**: `/raw/upload/fl_attachment/` (for documents)
2. **Method 2**: `/image/upload/fl_attachment/` (for PDF-as-image)  ✅ **THIS ONE WORKED**
3. **Method 3**: `/upload/fl_attachment/` (generic)
4. **Method 4**: Original URL (fallback)

### **Automatic Detection**
- Tests each URL in real-time
- Uses the first working URL
- No manual intervention needed

## 📊 **Current Status**
