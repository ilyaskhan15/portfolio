## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Django 5.1 STORAGES Setting
**Problem**: Django 5.1+ uses new `STORAGES` dict instead of `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE`  
**Solution**: Added modern `STORAGES` configuration:

```python
STORAGES = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage",
    },
    "staticfiles": {
        "BACKEND": "whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage",
    },
}
```

### Issue 2: INSTALLED_APPS Order
**Problem**: `staticfiles` was loaded before `cloudinary_storage`  
**Solution**: Reordered to ensure `cloudinary_storage` loads first

### Issue 3: Development Settings Override
**Problem**: `development.py` was overriding `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT`  
**Solution**: Removed the override to let Cloudinary handle it

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Deployment

### Image Upload Flow:
```
Admin uploads image
  ↓
Django receives upload
  ↓
STORAGES["default"] = MediaCloudinaryStorage
  ↓
Image sent to Cloudinary API
  ↓
Cloudinary stores image
  ↓
Returns URL: https://res.cloudinary.com/donwotyx2/...
  ↓
Django saves URL in database
  ↓
Image persists forever ✅
```

### Image URLs:
**Before**: `/media/portfolio/image.jpg` (disappears on restart)  
**After**: `https://res.cloudinary.com/donwotyx2/image/upload/v1/media/portfolio/image.jpg` (permanent)

## 🎨 What You'll See in Cloudinary

After uploading images through admin:

```
Cloudinary Media Library
└── media/
    ├── portfolio/
    │   ├── project_image_1.jpg
    │   └── project_image_2.png
    ├── blog/

## 💡 Key Changes Summary

### What Changed:
1. **Added STORAGES dict** (Django 5.1+ requirement)
2. **Fixed app order** (cloudinary_storage before staticfiles)
3. **Removed dev overrides** (let Cloudinary handle media)

### Why It Works Now:
- Django 5.1 looks for `STORAGES["default"]["BACKEND"]`
- Found: `cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage`
- All uploads now go through Cloudinary automatically

### Why It Didn't Work Before:
- Missing `STORAGES` dict (Django 5.1 requirement)
- Wrong app order (staticfiles loaded first)
- Dev settings override (forced local storage)
