# âœ… Google AdSense ads.txt - Quick Summary

## What Was Done
Successfully added `ads.txt` file for Google AdSense verification on your website.

## Files Created/Modified
1. âœ… Created `/static/ads.txt` with your AdSense publisher ID
2. âœ… Modified `/portfolio_blog/urls.py` to serve ads.txt at root level
3. âœ… Collected static files (ads.txt now in staticfiles/)

## Your ads.txt Content
```
google.com, pub-7667391240665296, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
```

## Testing
- **Local URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/ads.txt âœ… Working
- **Production URL**: https://muhammadilyas.tech/ads.txt (after deployment)

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Production
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add ads.txt for Google AdSense verification"
git push origin main
```

Your existing `build.sh` already includes `collectstatic`, so ads.txt will be automatically deployed!

### 2. Verify on Production
After deployment, check: https://muhammadilyas.tech/ads.txt

### 3. Google AdSense Verification
1. Go to your AdSense dashboard
2. Navigate to **Sites** â†’ **muhammadilyas.tech**
3. Wait 24-48 hours for Google to crawl and verify
4. Status will change from "Getting ready" to "Ready"

## How It Works
- `ads.txt` tells advertisers who is authorized to sell ad inventory on your site
- Google AdSense requires this file to verify your ownership
- File must be accessible at: `https://yourdomain.com/ads.txt`
- Must return plain text (not HTML)

## Troubleshooting
If Google shows "Not found" after deployment:
- Wait 24-48 hours (Google needs time to crawl)
- Clear CDN cache if using one
- Verify file is accessible at root URL
- Check file has plain text content type

## Important
âœ… Your publisher ID: `pub-7667391240665296`
âœ… File location: Root level (`/ads.txt`)
âœ… Content type: `text/plain`
âœ… Auto-deploys with your site

That's it! Your ads.txt is ready for Google AdSense verification! ðŸŽ‰
