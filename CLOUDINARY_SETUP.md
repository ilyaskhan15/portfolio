# Cloudinary Integration Guide

## Problem Solved
**Issue**: Images uploaded through admin panel on Render disappear after some time  
**Cause**: Render uses ephemeral filesystem - files are deleted when container restarts  
**Solution**: Use Cloudinary to store media files persistently in the cloud

---

## What Was Configured

### 1. Updated Django Settings ‚úÖ

#### `portfolio_blog/settings/base.py`
- Added `cloudinary_storage` and `cloudinary` to `INSTALLED_APPS`
- Configured Cloudinary credentials from environment variables
- Set `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'`

#### `portfolio_blog/settings/production.py`
- Removed local MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT (Cloudinary handles this)

### 2. Packages Already Installed ‚úÖ
The following packages are already in `requirements.txt`:
- `cloudinary==1.36.0`
- `django-cloudinary-storage==0.3.0`

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Get Cloudinary Credentials

1. **Sign up for Cloudinary** (FREE tier):
   - Go to: https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free
   - Sign up with email or Google

2. **Get your credentials** from Dashboard:
   - After login, you'll see your **Dashboard**
   - Look for the "Product Environment Credentials" section
   - You'll see:
     ```
     Cloud Name: your_cloud_name
     API Key: 123456789012345
     API Secret: your_api_secret_here
     ```

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Render

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**:
   - Login to https://dashboard.render.com
   - Select your web service (muhammadilyas)

2. **Add Environment Variables**:
   - Go to "Environment" tab
   - Click "Add Environment Variable"
   - Add these THREE variables:

   | Key | Value | Example |
   |-----|-------|---------|
   | `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Your cloud name | `dxyz123abc` |
   | `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | Your API key | `123456789012345` |
   | `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Your API secret | `AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz` |

3. **Save Changes**:
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Render will automatically redeploy

### Step 3: Deploy Your Code

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Cloudinary integration for persistent media storage"
git push origin main
```

Render will automatically:
1. Install dependencies
2. Run migrations
3. Deploy with new Cloudinary configuration

### Step 4: Verify It Works

1. **Go to Admin Panel**:
   ```
   https://muhammadilyas.tech/admin/
   ```

2. **Upload an Image**:
   - Go to Portfolio ‚Üí Projects (or any model with image)
   - Upload a new image
   - Save

3. **Check Cloudinary Dashboard**:
   - Go to https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library
   - You should see your uploaded image
   - The image URL will be: `https://res.cloudinary.com/YOUR_CLOUD_NAME/...`

4. **Verify Persistence**:
   - The image will now persist even after Render restarts
   - Images are stored in Cloudinary's CDN (fast delivery worldwide)

---

## How It Works

### Before (With Local Storage)
```
User uploads image ‚Üí Saved to /media/ folder ‚Üí Container restarts ‚Üí Files deleted ‚ùå
```

### After (With Cloudinary)
```
User uploads image ‚Üí Uploaded to Cloudinary ‚Üí Stored permanently in cloud ‚úÖ
```

### Image URL Changes
- **Before**: `https://muhammadilyas.tech/media/uploads/image.jpg`
- **After**: `https://res.cloudinary.com/YOUR_CLOUD_NAME/image/upload/v1234567890/uploads/image.jpg`

Django automatically handles this through `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE`.

---

## What Gets Stored on Cloudinary

All files uploaded through:
- ‚úÖ **Admin panel** image/file fields
- ‚úÖ **CKEditor** image uploads
- ‚úÖ **User profile** images
- ‚úÖ **Blog post** featured images
- ‚úÖ **Portfolio project** images
- ‚úÖ Any `ImageField` or `FileField` in your models

---

## Configuration Details

### Environment Variables Used
```python
CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
    'CLOUD_NAME': config('CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME', default=''),
    'API_KEY': config('CLOUDINARY_API_KEY', default=''),
    'API_SECRET': config('CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET', default=''),
}
```

### Storage Backend
```python
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
```

This tells Django to use Cloudinary for all media file operations:
- `model.image.save()` ‚Üí Uploads to Cloudinary
- `model.image.url` ‚Üí Returns Cloudinary URL
- `model.image.delete()` ‚Üí Deletes from Cloudinary

## Cloudinary Free Tier Limits

Perfect for your portfolio site:
- ‚úÖ **25 GB storage**
- ‚úÖ **25 GB bandwidth/month**
- ‚úÖ **Unlimited transformations**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Images still disappearing
**Solution**: Verify environment variables are set correctly on Render
```bash
# Check in Render dashboard under "Environment" tab
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

### Issue: Upload errors in admin
**Solution**: Check Render logs for Cloudinary errors
```bash
# In Render dashboard, go to "Logs" tab
# Look for errors mentioning "cloudinary" or "upload"
```

### Issue: Old images not showing
**Explanation**: Existing images in local storage won't be migrated automatically
**Solutions**:
1. **Re-upload** important images through admin panel
2. **Or** use Cloudinary's upload API to migrate existing files

---

## Testing Locally (Optional)

To test Cloudinary locally:

1. **Create `.env` file** (if not exists):
   ```bash
   # Add Cloudinary credentials
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

2. **Run development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. **Upload test image** through admin panel

4. **Check Cloudinary dashboard** - image should appear

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Optimize Existing Images
You can add transformation to serve optimized images:
```python
# In model or template
optimized_url = image.url.replace('/upload/', '/upload/q_auto,f_auto/')
```

### 2. Add Image Transformations
Create thumbnail versions automatically:
```python
# In models.py
from cloudinary.models import CloudinaryField

class Project(models.Model):
    image = CloudinaryField('image')
    
    def get_thumbnail(self):
        return self.image.build_url(width=300, height=200, crop='fill')
```

### 3. Backup Strategy
- Cloudinary stores your images safely
- Consider periodic exports for extra backup
- Download media library from Cloudinary dashboard
